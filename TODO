REBUS prototype1 - RELEASE ALPHA 2016 - 2025
December 31st 2025

Wlecome to the ALPHA release of the first prototype of REBUS 

This release contains code written in different periods as part of the research underlying the development of the instrument REBUS.
The code is currently based on the Bela API, however the development of REBUS started before BELA was even called Bela (it was a Beaglebone Black with audio cape) as part of the DSP module taught by Andrew McPherson at Media & Arts Technology DTC at Queen Mary University of London.


Please refer to the README for an indepth history of the material contained in this release, as a number of videos, releases, papers, performances and publications have used the code included in this release.

The code contains different phases of development and aproaches, including Claude Heiland-Hallen's attempt at creating a REBUS dedicated architecture and REBUS library. You may find this code incoherent and occasionally confusing, so if this bothers you, please wait for the BETA release. 

Claude's library contains code ported from his Clive software, as well as snippets copied directly from Pure Data: if this excites you, please have a look! 

We are happy to share this as a selection of a variety of approaches and experiments, some code has been used in user studies, other code has been used to record albums, tracks, workshops, public presentations, and a variety of outputs.


TODO

[1] integrate Claude's approach and library with the rest of the BELA experiments that are out there. This implies the following:

### use the Bela API instead of recreating in memory redundant functions and variables:

- pi -> M_PI
- twopi
- clamp -> constrain

### separate headers and libraries so that each composition only compiles the necessary code

### integrate the Bela own dsp.h with Claude's dsp.h and dsp_neon.h 

### cosider whether a number of functions are necessary or can be omitted

- wrapto()
- wrapat()
- trisaw()
- mtof()
- ftom()
- dbtorms()
- rmstodb()
- dbtopow()
- powtodb()
- bytebeat()
- bitcrush()
- bandpass() (for biquad)
- notch() (for biquad; is used, but only in part of library concerned with "two-wires")
- vcf(), vcff() (but keep one as documentation for neon vcf4)
- lopf() (single precision version of lop())
- delread2()
- delread4()

### include further documentation and instruction for the community to be able to use the material and contribute to it. 
Also, it will be used for teaching part of the Advanced Audiovisual Processing module taught at Goldsmiths by xname.

[2] Add more traditional electronic music compositional techniques adapted to REBUS, for example:

- Euclidian 
- more controllable drum machines
- multi sample players

[3] Visualisation

- use the Bela GUI to create enticing visualisations in Javascript, merging the scope function and the possibility of making interactive audiovisual installations.

[4] Hardware
- add a screen to support the user in understanding what composition they are playing.


REBUS will continue its journey in parallel pathways and dimensions, we hope you enjoy our code.


Made with love by
xname & the REBUS team!!
